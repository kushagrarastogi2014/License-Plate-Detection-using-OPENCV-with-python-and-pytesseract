# License-Plate-Detection-using-OPENCV-with-python-and-pytesseract
This is a license plate detection system made using opencv in python as well as pytesseract,numpy and imutils libraries of python. This requires an OCR(Optical Character Recognition) for detection of text in an image. This project requires following steps:
License Plate Detection
Character Segmentation
Character Recognition
For an OCR, I have used tesseract for text detection on license plates.
